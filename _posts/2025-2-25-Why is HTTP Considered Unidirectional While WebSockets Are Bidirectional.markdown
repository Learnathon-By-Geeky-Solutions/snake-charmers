title: "Why is HTTP Considered Unidirectional While WebSockets Are Bidirectional?"

Recently, while exploring WebSockets, which are crucial for implementing real-time communication in our system, a question popped into my mindâ€”one that might be common for many:

Both **HTTP** and **WebSockets** use **TCP** under the hood (yes, they do, if you didnâ€™t know). And **TCP is inherently bidirectional**. So why do we say that **HTTP is unidirectional** while **WebSockets are bidirectional**?

## Understanding the Difference

After digging deeper, hereâ€™s what I realized:

It all comes down to **protocol design**. 

- **HTTP** restricts TCPâ€™s bidirectional nature by enforcing a strict request-response model. The client sends a request, and the server responds. Once done, the connection is typically closed unless the `Keep-Alive` header is used to keep it open. Even then, the communication remains request-drivenâ€”it merely reuses the connection for future requests.

- **WebSockets**, on the other hand, leverage TCPâ€™s full capabilities by establishing a persistent connection that remains open. This allows **real-time, two-way communication** where both the client and server can send messages at any time without waiting for a request.

## Key Takeaway

> Itâ€™s not TCP that limits HTTPâ€”itâ€™s how the protocol is designed.

While HTTP is great for traditional request-response interactions, WebSockets are a better fit for scenarios that require continuous, real-time data exchange, such as chat applications, live notifications, and stock price updates.

This distinction highlights how protocols shape communication behavior even when built on the same transport layer. ðŸš€
